Welcome to the DeepdiveCrystallography diffraction classification web service

Quickstart Guide:

prerequisites: python 2.7 and an internet connection

To predict the crystal structure simply start the Diffraction Classifier by
running the command:

python DiffractionClassifier.py

Then follow the series of prompts.

Advanced usage:
	You can specify the data you'd like to load by adding --data FILEPATH_TO_YOUR_DATA
	to the function call.

	Similarly you specify the calibration by modifying the calibration.json file and adding --calibration calibration.json to the 
	function call.
